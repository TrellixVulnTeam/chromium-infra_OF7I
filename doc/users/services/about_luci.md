LUCI is a replacement for Buildbot that runs primarily on
the Google Cloud Platform and is designed to scale well for large projects.

LUCI is the CI system for the Chromium project. All Chromium developers should
already be using the LUCI UI ([ci.chromium.org](https://ci.chromium.org)).

For more public information, see [luci-py
README.md](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/luci/luci-py/+/refs/heads/master/README.md).
For Googlers, see go/luci.
