// This proto definition describes the structure of the requirements for deployment
// of a host.
//
// Put this proto in chrome infra repo for 3 reasons:
//     * It's possible that we migrate automation services back to chrome infra, and we
//       don't need to move around protos at that time.
//     * There're some commonly used deployment units in UFS and automation services.
//     * All proto here is copied to google3 via copybara, so current Chrome MDM service
//       in google3 could also use it.
