Short description:


=== Create a root CIPD prefix ===
Prefix:
Owning group:
What will be there:

NOTE: editing ACLs of existing CIPD prefix is responsibility of the prefix
OWNER, which you can find via `cipd acl-list <prefix>` command, e.g.:
  $ cipd acl-list infra/tools/cpython

(DO NOT DELETE) Instruction for trooper: To create a new root prefix, run the
following `cipd` command:
  $ cipd acl-edit <new_prefix>/ -owner group:<owning_group>

After that, verify owner is set correctly by manually navigating to the new
prefix (i.e. https://chrome-infra-packages.appspot.com/p/<new_prefix>)

Data type: <Swarming host> | Buildbucket | CQ

LUCI Project:

Table / View:

several related LUCI projects)

**NOTE to whoever handles a bug: add "BigQuery Data Viewer" role only.
